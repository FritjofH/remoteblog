# My Blog

It's built with Ruby on Rails. Currently about 2 weeks into learning the language and all about how it works.

## Installation

Use bundle to install all gems

```bash
bundle
```

## Usage

Navigate to localhost:3005 and play around.

Only one author can exist at a time.

## Todo

* Finding posts through the tags created with acts_as_taggable_on gem. Maybe click and then find all articles with the same tag?
* Image texts in articles
* Currently you can't edit one field at a time for authors, you must edit them all
* General improvements to tag handling. Removing and adding them one at a time
* Removing posts once created (with some additional verification?)
* Heroku and hosting
