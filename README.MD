# My Blog

It's built with Ruby on Rails. Currently about 2 weeks into learning the language and all about how it works.

## Pre-reqs
Requires a local installation of postgres. Credentials can be found/edited in the database.yml.

## Installation

Use bundle to install all gems

```bash
bundle install
```

## Usage

Navigate to localhost:3005 and play around.

Only one author can exist at a time.

## Todo

* Currently you can't edit one field at a time for authors, you must edit them all
* Heroku stability
* Improve image saving for posts
* Improve page titles (make them dynamic)
* Probably redo architecture for the about page
* Look into other gems such as Meta Tags and Social Share button
