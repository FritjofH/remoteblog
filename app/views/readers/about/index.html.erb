  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    This blog is a small project to get to know Ruby on Rails. I've previously used with PHP (probably 8-9 years ago), and Angular 2 when it comes to web development. But recently I've mainly been working with Swing applications and the WebSwing-library.
    
    So I felt like it was time to look into something new, hence this blog.

      If you can't find me in front of a computer, then I'm probably out exercising in some way. During the weeks I usually go bouldering, go to the gym, play squash or padel. When I have a few days off work I try to go outdoors, skiing, hiking, ice skating or some other kind of small adventure.

      I feel like that defines me quite well as a person. I always want to stay active and experience new new things. That goes for my professional life as well. I want to improve my skills and experience new things!
